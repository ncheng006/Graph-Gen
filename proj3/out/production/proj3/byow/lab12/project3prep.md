# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer:

Mine was done by basically by making helper methods while they did one using classes.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer:

A hexagon is like gneerating the rooms and the tesselation is sort of like generating hallways.
**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer:

Creating a room.
**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer:
A hallway has a width or length of 3 and can have turns while a room can have any numbers. They are both generated pseduorandomly.
